      "[NEWS] The microbiota regulates immune defense against respiratory tract infections, including influenza virus infection. The 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in the USA was studied to understand the transmission parameters of the virus. Prior influenza infection induces heterosubtypic immunity that accelerates viral clearance of a second strain. The memory phase of the CD4 T-cell response to influenza virus infection involves the specificities present in the primary response to live influenza infection. During the 2011-2012 season, influenza surveillance activity was reported in Texas, USA. Oseltamivir treatment of mice before or after mild influenza infection was studied to understand its effects. The IHS Employee Immunization Program aims to reduce staff absenteeism during the influenza season and prevent influenza infection. Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein can be used to differentiate between mixed infection and H1N1 influenza infection. A patent search report on pandemic influenza preparedness was conducted by WIPO. The endocytic routes of influenza A virus infection involve dynamin-dependent, clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and other pathways.\n",
